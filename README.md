# What is pulmonary fibrosis ? 

Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for you to breathe and at a severe stage makes you become progressively more short of breath.

# What we need to predict ?

We need to predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.

# Evaluation metrics :-

- The evaluation metric is a modified version of Laplace Log Likelihood. 
Predictions are evaluated with a modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood.
